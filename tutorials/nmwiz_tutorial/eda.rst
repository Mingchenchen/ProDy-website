Essential Dynamics Analysis
===============================================================================

In this part, we will perform essential dynamics analysis calculations
for a p38 MAP kinase trajectory and compare results with normal modes from
ANM calculations.  You will need following files:

  * `NMWiz Tutorial files (ZIP) <nmwiz_tutorial_files.zip>`_
  * `NMWiz Tutorial files (TGZ) <nmwiz_tutorial_files.tgz>`_

This files contain frame from a 40 ns long simulation of p38.
Detailed analysis of this trajectory can be found in [AB11]_.

Load the contents of this file into VMD as follows::

  $ vmd p38.pdb p38_100frames.dcd


Click on :guilabel:`ProDy Interface` for performing ANM and EDA jobs.

EDA Calculation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Select :guilabel:`PCA Calculation` in the :guilabel:`ProDy Job Settings` panel.
Set :guilabel:`First frame` 1 to exclude the X-ray coordinates from the
calculation.  You may also check :guilabel:`aligned` to make ProDy skip
alignment step in PCA/EDA calculations when you already have done the alignment
in VMD. In this case, the frames are already aligned.
Click :guilabel:`Submit Job` and results will be loaded automatically when
:ref:`prody-pca` command finishes the calculations.

ANM Calculation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will perform ANM calculations for all Cα atoms and keep the rest of the
parameters unchanged.  To properly align the structures used for EDA and ANM,
set :guilabel:`First frame` to 100 for the ANM calculation.  Click 
:guilabel:`Submit Job` and results obtained from :ref:`prody-anm` command 
will load automatically.

Comparison
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each dataset you load into or generate via NMWiz, a GUI will pop up with
independent controls for normal mode display, animation, and plotting. Select
PC 1 and ANM mode 1 and try to get the view in the image in VMD display.


Suggestions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NMWiz writes a DCD or PDB file for PCA/EDA calculations.  For large systems
and long trajectories you may try one or more of the following for speedier
calculations:

  * select a subset of atoms, e.g. Cα atoms
  * select a subset of frames, e.g. set :guilabel:`Skip frame` a value
    greater than 0
  * use :guilabel:`DCD file` for faster IO operations and less disk usage
  * alternatively, if you have trajectories in DCD format, use :ref:`prody-pca`
    directly to obtain results in :ref:`nmd-format`
