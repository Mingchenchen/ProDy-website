Principal Component Analysis
===============================================================================

We will use ProDy Interface of NMWiz plugin to perform a comparative analysis
of ubiquitin dynamics predicted using theory using anisotropic network model
(ANM) and inferred from experimental structures using principal component
analysis (PCA).

Let's fetch a PDB files that contains a solution (NMR) structure using
:ref:`prody-fetch` command::

  $ prody fetch 2k39

Alternatively, you may use a browser to download these files.
:pdb:`2k39` file can be loaded into VMD at startup as follows::

  $ vmd 2k39.pdb

This file contains 116 solution structure models of the protein Ubiquitin, so
it will be suitable for comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental
observations.

:guilabel:`NMWiz - Main` window can be accessed via the
:menuselection:`Extensions --> Analysis` menu of :guilabel:`VMD Main`
window.  Click on :guilabel:`ProDy Interface` and a window listing
molecules and ProDy jobs will pop up.


Atom Selection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In both ANM and PCA calculations, we will omit the flexible C-terminal tail of
ubiquitin, since incorporating this flexible tail skews the calculations and
results highlight local tail motions instead of collective global motions that
we are interested in.

We enter the selection string ``resid <= 70 and protein and name CA`` and
click :guilabel:`Select`.  70 CÎ± atoms will be selected for calculations.


PCA Calculation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, we will use all ubiquitin models for the PCA calculation.  Select
:guilabel:`PCA Calculation` in the :guilabel:`ProDy Job Settings` panel.
Keeping :guilabel:`PCA (EDA) Settings` unchanged, click :guilabel:`Submit Job`.
Results will be loaded automatically when :ref:`prody-pca` command finishes
the calculations.


ANM Calculation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, we perform ANM calculations, which is the job type selected by default.
We will use 78th NMR model for ANM calculations, because this model is the
closest to the average of the ubiquitin NMR ensemble. Since VMD frame (model)
numbers start from 0, we will change the :guilabel:`Frame number` to read 77.

We keep the rest of the parameters unchanged, and click :guilabel:`Submit Job`.
This action will run :ref:`prody-anm` command in the background and load the
results when calculations are finished.


Comparison
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each dataset you load into or generate via NMWiz, a GUI will pop up with
independent controls for normal mode display, animation, and plotting. Select
PC 2 and ANM mode 2 and try to get the view in the image in VMD display.

Clicking on :guilabel:`Options` buttons will expand the GUI showing more
controls for fine tuning the display.  Exploring these options is left
to you.  You can adjust the quality of the arrows and protein to get a
publication quality image.  In addition, you can make mobility plots and
generate animations for the selected mode.
