Intermolecular Contacts
===============================================================================

This examples shows how to identify intermolecular contacts, e.g. protein
atoms interacting with a bound inhibitor.  A structure of a protein-ligand
complex in PDB format will be used.  Output will be :class:`.Selection`
instances that points to atoms matching the contact criteria given by the user.
:class:`.Selection` instances can be used as input to other
functions for further analysis.

Simple contact selections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We start by importing everything from the ProDy package:

.. ipython:: python

   from prody import *
   from pylab import *
   ion()

ProDy selection engine has a powerful feature that enables identifying
intermolecular contacts very easily. We will see this by identifying protein
atoms interacting with an inhibitor.

We start with parsing a PDB file that contains a protein and a bound ligand.

.. ipython:: python

   pdb = parsePDB('1zz2')

:pdb:`1zz2` contains an inhibitor bound p38 MAP kinase structure. Residue name
of inhibitor is :pdbhet:`B11`. Protein atoms interacting with the inhibitor can
simply be identified as follows:

.. ipython:: python

   contacts = pdb.select('protein and within 4 of resname B11')
   repr(contacts)

``'protein and within 4 of resname B11'`` is interpreted as select protein
atoms that are within 4 A of residue whose name is B11. This selects
protein atoms that within 4 A of the inhibitor.

Contacts between different atom groups
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, the protein and the ligand may be in separate files.
We will imitate this case by making copies of protein and ligand.

.. ipython:: python

   inhibitor = pdb.select('resname B11').copy()
   repr(inhibitor)
   protein = pdb.select('protein').copy()
   repr(protein)

We see that inhibitor molecule contains 33 atoms.

Now we have two different atom groups, and we want protein atoms that are
within 4 Å of the inhibitor.

.. ipython:: python

   contacts = protein.select('within 4 of inhibitor', inhibitor=inhibitor)
   repr(contacts)

We found that 50 protein atoms are contacting with the inhibitor.
In this case, we passed the atom group *inhibitor* as a keyword argument
to the selection function. Note that the keyword must match that is used
in the selection string.


Composite contact selections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's try something more sophisticated. We select Cα atoms of
residues that have at least one atom interacting with the inhibitor:

.. ipython:: python

   contacts_ca = protein.select(
      'calpha and (same residue as within 4 of inhibitor)',
      inhibitor=inhibitor)
   repr(contacts_ca)

In this case, ``'calpha and (same residue as within 4 of inhibitor)'`` is
interpreted as select Cα atoms of residues that have at least
one atom within 4 A of any inhibitor atom.

This shows that, 20 residues have atoms interacting with the inhibitor.

Spherical atom selections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, one can give arbitrary coordinate arrays as keyword arguments to
identify atoms in a spherical region. Let's find backbone atoms within 5
Å of point (25, 73, 13):

.. ipython:: python

   sel = protein.select('backbone and within 5 of somepoint',
                        somepoint=np.array((25, 73, 13)))


Fast contact selections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For repeated and faster contact identification :class:`.Contacts` class is
recommended.

We pass the protein as argument:

.. ipython:: python

   protein_contacts = Contacts(protein)

The following corresponds to ``"within 4 of inhibitor"``:

.. ipython:: python

   contants = protein_contacts.select(4, inhibitor)
   repr(contacts)


This method is 20 times faster than the one in the previous part, but it is
limited to selecting only contacting atoms (other selection arguments cannot
be passed). Again, it should be noted that :class:`.Contacts` does not update
the KDTree that it uses, so it should be used if protein coordinates does not
change between selections.
